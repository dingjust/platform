# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/assets/temp/pdf.png
    - packages/assets/temp/word.png
    - packages/assets/temp/excel.png
    - packages/assets/temp/login_background.png

  fonts:
    - family: b2bIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/iconfont1.ttf
    - family: b2bIcons2
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/iconfont2.ttf
    - family: b2bIcons21
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/iconfont21.ttf
    - family: b2bIcons22
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/fonts/iconfont22.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
